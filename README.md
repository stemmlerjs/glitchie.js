# Glitchie.js
A JavaScript library for creating glitch art.

## About
This is an in-progress port of [this Java program](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/glitchie) I made a few years ago into a reusable JavaScript library.

## How to use

### For development
Run `npm run dev`. Then open up `src/index.html` in the browser.

## Logic

```javascript

interface Glitch () {

  prepare() {}
}
```
